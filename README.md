# prochat
An advanced web-based chat application.

## Tool and Technologies
We use the MERN stack for this application.
MongoDB for the database, Express.js and Node.js as the middleware, and React.js for the UI.

Visual Studio Code is the preferred code editor for the development of this project.
We will have all the presets for the editor saved in the repo for better collaboration.

## Installation process

Prerequisites:

Node and NPM
Install the latest versions of Node(v20) and NPM(v9)

Clone the repository and go to the client folder in your terminal.
Run `npm install` in the client folder. This installs all the packages required for our UI.
Then navigate to the server folder and run `npm install` again to install all the packages for our backend and database.




NOTES-TO-SELF

Command to create a react app
`npx create-react-app client`
This creates a folder called client where the react app is created for the UI

Commands to create a server directory and install the required packages
```
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install mongodb express cors dotenv
```
